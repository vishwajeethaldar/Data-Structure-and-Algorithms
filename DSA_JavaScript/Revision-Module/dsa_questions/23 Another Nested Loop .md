# Another Nested Loop 
    Description

    You are given a number stored in a variable with the name num

    Printnumlines such that there are numbers from1 to i, such that on each line you print only one number. Also, i represents all the numbers from 1 to num

    For example, consider the value stored in num = 5

    Therefore, the required output will be

    1
    1 
    2
    1 
    2 
    3
    1 
    2 
    3 
    4
    1 
    2 
    3 
    4
    5

    Input
    The first and the only line of the input contains the value stored innum.


    Output
    Print the output as shown in the problem statement


    Sample Input 1 
    4

    Sample Output 1
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    3
    1
    2
    3
    4


###  Hint

    In the sample test case, the value stored innum = 4. Therefore, we start printing the numbers, such that, we print all the numbers from [1,1], then all the numbers from [1,2], then all the numbers from [1,3], and finally all the numbers from [1,4]

    Hence, the final output becomes

    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    3
    1
    2
    3
    4
