# Q11. Compare Four Numbers II 
    
    Description

    You are given four numbers stored in variables with the following names

    one, two, three, four

    If the value of any one of the following expression is true, print Yes, else print No

    1. one > two 

    2. three > four


    Input
    The first and the only line of the input contains four numbers, the values stored in the variables one, two, three, four


    Output
    If any one of the expressions 1 and 2, given in the problem statement is true, print Yes, else print No


    Sample Input 1 

    1 2 4 3
    Sample Output 1

    Yes
    Hint

    In the sample test case, the value stored inone = 1, two = 2, three = 4, four = 3

    Now, in this case, condition 2, as mentioned in the problem statement is true, but condition 1 is false, as the value stored in one is lesser than the value stored in two. Hence, the output is Yes
