# Q7. Two Sum One Numbers II 
   
    Description

    You are given five numbers, stored in the variables with the following names
    one, two, three, four, five

    Find the value ofsum1 and sum2, such that

    - sum1 = one + two 

    - sum2 = three + four

    If the value of sum1 or sum2 is greater than the value stored in variable five, print Yes, else print No


    Input
    The first and the only line of the input contains the value stored in variables one, two, three, four, five respectively


    Output
    Print Yes, if either the value ofsum1 or sum2 is greater than the value stored in five, else print No


    Sample Input 1 
    1 2 3 4 5 

    Sample Output 1
    Yes

# Hint
#
    In the sample test case, the value stored inone = 1, two = 2, three = 3, four = 4, five = 5

    Therefore, the value of

    sum1 = one + two = 1 + 2 = 3

    sum2 = three + four = 3 + 4 = 7

    Now, the value of sum1 is lesser than the value stored in five, but the value stored in sum2 is greater than five. Therefore, the answer isYes
