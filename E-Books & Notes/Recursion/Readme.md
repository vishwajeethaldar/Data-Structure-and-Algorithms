<h1 align="center"> Recursion</h1>

> In programming recursion is a method call to the same method. In other words, a recursive method is
one that calls itself. 
# 
> A recursive function is one that calls itself

## **Recursion Defination**
- Every recursive function definition includes two parts:
    - Base case(s) (non-recursive)
        > One or more simple cases that can be done right away
    - Recursive case(s)
        > One or more cases that require solving “simpler” version(s) of the original problem.
        - By “simpler” , we mean “smaller” or “shorter” or “closer to the base case”.
